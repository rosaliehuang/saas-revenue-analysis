# Project: SaaS Product Revenue Analysis

This project explores how a fictional SaaS platform (inspired by tools like [Stan Store](https://www.stan.store/) and [The Leap](https://www.theleap.co/)) performs in terms of revenue and product efficiency. The platform allows creators to sell digital products such as courses, templates, memberships, and more.

The goal is to answer key business questions using real-world data practices: cleaning, exploration, and deriving actionable insights for marketing and product decisions.

> 📌 Note: This is a portfolio project for learning purposes. The dataset is artificially generated.
